# CPU Stress Test Project
**version 1.1 beta**

This project is designed to stress test the CPU of any Windows system and also contains template to deploy  Azure virtual machine (VM) and deploye script automatically there. The project includes several scripts and configuration files to automate the deployment and execution of the stress test. This is exquisite vintage-ish craftwork, no modern tech involved 😉

## Quick deployment

[![Default Deployment](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fivanrusakov%2Flabbox%2Fmain%2Fcpu_stress.json)

## Project Files
- **`deploy.cmd`**: Batch script to automate the deployment process.
- **`execute.ps1`**: Staring script configured within ARM template, which deploying 
- **`cpu_stress.json`**: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to deploy the VM and necessary resources.
- **`cpu_stress.cfg`**: Configuration file listing the files (one by line) to be installed by `install_task.cmd`.
- **`cpu_stress.cmd`**: Batch script to start multiple instances (one per core) of the CPU stress test `cpu_stress.vbs`. `⚠️ Use with caution ⚠️`.
- **`cpu_stress.vbs`**: VBScript to create an infinite loop, simulating CPU load, single threaded.
- **`install_task.cmd`**: Batch script creates a scheduled task to run the stress test on VM startup.
- **`cleanup.cmd`**: Deletes all files in current folder except itself.  `⚠️ Use with caution ⚠️`.
- **`date_add.vbs`**: Helper script calculating date in future. Can be used wtih `schtasks` to configure task to run in later.
- **`run_wait.cmd`**: Helper script to run any command with timeout.

## How to Use
**Metod 1:** Run manually
- **Option 1**: Clone the repository:
  
   ```sh
    git clone --depth 1 <repository-url>
    # ... or update existing copy:
    cd <existing-repo-directory>
    git fetch --depth 1
    git reset --hard origin/master
   ```
- **Option 2**: Use PS script to download directly to target system:

   ``` powershell 
   # List of URLs to download
   $urls = @(
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/cpu_stress.cmd",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/cpu_stress.vbs",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/cpu_stress.cfg",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/install_task.cmd",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/deploy.cmd",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/cleanup.cmd",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/date_add.vbs",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/execute.ps1",
   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanrusakov/labbox/main/run_wait.cmd"
   )

   # Download each file and overwrite if it exists
   foreach ($url in $urls) {
      $fileName = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($url)
      $outputPath = Join-Path -Path (Get-Location) -ChildPath $fileName
      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $outputPath
   }

   Write-Output "Files downloaded and overwritten successfully."
   ```
   Execute either `deploy.cmd` or `cpu_stress.cmd` depending on your preferences.

**Metod 2:** Deploy with VM from template

   Use the `cpu_stress.json` ARM template to deploy the VM and necessary resources. This can be done via the Azure portal or using Azure CLI:
   ```sh
   az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file cpu_stress.json
   ```
Also, you can use button in [quick deployment](#quick-deployment) section above.

## Monitor the VM
The VM will run the stress test, and you can monitor its performance via the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) under the *Metrics* menu or other monitoring tools.

## Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and funds to deploy resources in your Azure subscription.
- Modify the `cpu_stress.json` template parameters as needed for your environment.
- The stress test will utilize 100% of the CPU, which may impact the responsiveness of the VM. Adjust the priority in `cpu_stress.cmd` if needed or use command line arguments.

Ensure you understand the implications of running a CPU stress test and deploying resources in your Azure subscription before proceeding.

## TODO
- [ ] Make install_task usable for schedulled tasks with options to run on startup, at logon and at the specific time.
- [x] Hide deployment output with nul in ARM template
